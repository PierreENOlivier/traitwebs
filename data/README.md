# Appendix C - Data

Table C.1. Pairwise list of predator and prey interactions for each habitat. The pairwise list is splitted between habitats and can be used to reconstruct each individual habitat or the metaweb of the Åland Islands by removing the duplicated trophic links. The column ‘Sources’ includes either ‘Gut contents’ for data collected in situ or an ID (e.g. C1) referencing observations from the literature. Detailed citations are listed in Table C.2.

Table C.2. Sources for trophic links included in the pairwise list (see Table C.1.) Each source is associated with an ID that cross-references the source to a specific trophic interaction.

Table C.3. Trait list for each species in each habitat. The trait list is a binary table that contains ‘1s’ for the presence of a trait modality, and ‘0s’ otherwise.
