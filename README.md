Supplementary tables

Table B.1. List of observed consumer-resource trait associations, with their observation and significance in all four habitats (Fucus, Rock, Zostera and Sand). In the presence columns, 0 indicates absence, 1 indicates presence. In the significance columns, NA indicates that the association was not observed in that specific habitat; N.S. corresponds to observed associations that are non-significant; '\*' indicates significance at p-value < 0.05; '\*\*' indicates significance at p-value < 0.01; '\*\*\*' indicates significance at p-value < 0.001.

Table B.2. Module memberships of consumer and resource trait categories in all four habitat trait webs. ‘TM_#’ is the index of the module member. ‘Count_Categories’ gives the number of consumer or resource trait categories involved in a module. ‘Size’ is the product of the number of consumer and resource trait categories included within the same module. It indicates how many consumer-resource trait associations were possible inside a module and gives an estimate of the size of a module, for comparability. N.B. Categories were re-arranged for comparability and their index does not necessarily correspond to the order they appeared on the graph.
